# Docking and cable management
- Sit-stand adjustable desks: try out both positions to check that cables don't snag, overly bend, and don't stress the connectors
- Clear off the whole desk
  - Place 2 screens, a mouse and a keyboard on the desk
  - Move any existing equipment off the desk or to hang behind the desk
  - Any existing that can't be moved, or new that can't be placed off the desk, is placed to the side

# Monitors
