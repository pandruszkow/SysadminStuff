Taskbar
=======

Remove superfluous taskbar items as follows, using taskbar's right-click menu:

* Cortana: `Show Cortana button` (untick)
* Search: `Search ➞ Hidden` (select)
* Task View: `Show Task View button` (untick)
* People: `Show People on the taskbar` (untick)
* News and interests (news and weather): `News and interests ➞ Turn off` (select)

Enable useful features and configure miscellanea, in `right-click menu ➞ Taskbar settings`:
* Peek preview: `On`
* Location: `Bottom`
* Notification area ➞ `Select which icons appear on the taskbar` (aka system tray icons):
 - Visible: Outlook, battery indicator, OneDrive, connectivity (VPN clients), Communicators, volume control
 - Hidden: pointless driver/third-party vendor tray icons
 - Hidden: all rarely used icons
* Notification area ➞ `Turn system icons on or off`:
  * Input indicator: `Off` (not necessary if switching to Polish keyboard layout permanently)
  * Action Centre: `Off` (oh, how I hate this thing)
  * Location: `Off` (this should be disabled anyhow, so no need to see its status)
  * Meet Now: `Off`

Start Menu
==========
The default Start Menu can be successfully replaced with [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases), formerly known as [Classic Shell](http://www.classicshell.net/). This avoids the hassle of dealing with tiles that appear and re-appear for some reason after deletion, and brings back a faster, more familiar Start Menu (if this is what you're looking for).

My personal configuration:
