Start Menu
==========
The default Start Menu can be successfully replaced with [Classic Shell](http://www.classicshell.net/). This avoids the hassle of dealing with tiles that appear and re-appear for some reason after deletion, and brings back a more familiar Start Menu (if this is what you're looking for).

My personal configuration:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(with `Show all settings` enabled, listed by tab)

**Start Menu Style**
  - Windows 7 style
  
**Main Menu**
  - All Programs style
    - Inside main menu
      - Show Metro apps: `Off`
      - Show folders first: `Off`
  - Show recent or frequent programs
    - Show recent Metro apps: `Off`
  - Shutdown command: `Lock`
  
**Search Box**
  - Search programs and settings
    - Search Metro apps: `Off`
  - Search files
    - Organize by library: `Off`
  - Search the Internet: `Off`
  


**Customize Start Menu** (set everything to hidden, except for items below)
  - User files: `Display as a link`
  - OneDrive: `Display as a menu`
  - Downloads: `Display as a menu`
  - \<custom Documents folder\>: `Display as a menu`
  - Recent items: `Display as a menu`
  - This PC: `Display as a link`
  - Control Panel: `Display as a menu`
  - Run: `Display this item`
  - Windows security: `Display this item`

Taskbar
=======
Hidden in right-click menu:
  - Cortana (`Cortana -> Hidden`)
  - Task View button
  - People button

Taskbar settings:
- Peek preview: `On`
- Location: `Bottom`
- `Turn system icons on or off` ->
  - Input indicator: `Off` (not necessary if switching to Polish keyboard layout permanently)
  - Action Centre: `Off` (oh, how I hate this thing)
  - Meet Now: `Off`

Tray icons:
 - Visible: Outlook, battery indicator, Communicators, volume control
 - Hidden: pointless driver/third-party vendor tray icons
 - Hidden: all rarely used icons
