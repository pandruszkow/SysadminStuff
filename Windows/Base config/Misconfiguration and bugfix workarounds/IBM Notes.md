# Minimise to tray

IBM Notes (formerly Lotus Notes) does not have a setting for minimise to tray, but there is a workaround in the form of the included IBM Notes Minder utility. Simply replace your IBM Notes shortcut in `Startup` folder of the Start Menu with the shortcut for the IBM Notes Minder.

You can now completely close the IBM Notes window, while the Minder will periodically check for new mail and pop up a notification if something new arrives. Once it does, the tray icon will change from grey to blue, and (if enabled in Minder properties) a notification window will pop up. You can double-click the Minder icon to launch the full Notes application.

Pros:
 - removes clutter from taskbar
 - uses a fraction of RAM of the full IBM Notes
 
Cons:
 - may not work with password managers, so have to type in Lotus mailbox password on every boot
 - only allows checking every 5 minutes or more (check interval cannot be reduced below that)
 - have to wait for full Notes to boot up and launch after double-clicking, as opposed to Outlook just un-minimising an already-running window
