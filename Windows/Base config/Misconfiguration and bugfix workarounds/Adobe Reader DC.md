# Adobe Reader DC

## Enable document thumbnails in Windows Explorer
Adobe Reader used to provide thumbnails for PDF files viewed in Windows Explorer, but for some reason that default seems to have changed recently. To re-enable thumbnails, perform the steps below.

1. Open Adobe Reader DC
2. Open `Edit -> Preferences` in the main toolbar
3. Go to `General` tab on the left-hand side
4. Tick `Enable PDF thumbnail previews in Windows Explorer`

## Set UI size to small
Adobe Reader's default UI size is too large for my liking. The steps below allow shrinking the UI size to something more managable.

1. Open Adobe Reader DC
2. Open `Edit -> Preferences` in the main toolbar
3. Go to `General` tab on the left-hand side
4. Set `Scale for screen resolution (restart required)` radio button to `No Scaling`
5. Restart the application
