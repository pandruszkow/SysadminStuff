## 1:1 zoom

When editing graphics with GIMP for printing, it is often useful to see them in 1:1 scale while editing (e.g. to make sure that the element that's meant to be 1cm wide is in fact 1cm wide). This can be accomplished by turning off the "dot for dot" view mode.

1. Make sure the screen DPI is correct (set in `Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Display -> Monitor resolution`)

2. Make sure that the printing DPI is correct (set in `Image -> Print size`, but you should've set this already when you were creating the GIMP document and were told to choose the page size and working DPI).

3. Untick `View -> Dot for dot` and set image zoom on the bottom toolbar to 100%.

Your image should now be 1:1 to scale with the physical printout once you print it.
