# Dell 3008WFP (aka Dell 3008W)

30" LCD capable of running at 2560x1600 natively over DisplayPort and DVI dual-link.

The HDMI input port is HDMI 1.1, so it's only capable of accepting input up to 1920x1200 over HDMI.

## Getting 2560x1600 to it using modern-day equipment

There are 2 options with this screen: 

* DisplayPort - probably the most realistic option for most modern laptops.
* DVI dual-link output - if the PC already supports that? Great! Problem solved. If it doesn't, DisplayPort may be a better option. DVI dual-link is notoriously hard to obtain via adapters, because HDMI is single-link and it's pretty hard to make two links out of one.

## Power usage

The manual isn't joking when it presents the power requirements. It measurably draws 170W at full brightness, so you probably want to turn it down to 60 or 80 percent brightness for normal use.

## Factory reset

Unplug everything. Hold down the power button for 15 seconds and then release. Plug everything back in. You should see an image on the screen and everything should be reset to factory defaults.
