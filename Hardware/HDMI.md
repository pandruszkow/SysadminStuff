# HDMI

## Resolution support by HDMI version:

1080p / 1920x1200: HDMI 1.1/1.2 @ 60Hz

2560x1440 (1440p): HDMI 1.2 @ 30Hz, HDMI 1.3 @ 60Hz

2560x1600: HDMI 1.4. Confirmed that Dell 3008WFP is able to accept this res @ 30Hz via HDMI, but I don't know whether this is universal across HDMI 1.1 devices.
