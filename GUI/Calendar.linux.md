Gnome Calendar is surprisingly usable for view-only configuration.

1. Go to `https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/options/calendar/SharedCalendars/publishedCalendars`
2. Calendar icon -> `Manage Calendars...` -> `Add Calendar...`
3. Paste in the URL of the calendar, click `Add`
4. Rename calendar manually to the desired name, change colour to your liking
5. Done
