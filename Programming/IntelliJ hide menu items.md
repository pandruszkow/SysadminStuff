# Hiding menu items in IntelliJ

To remove superfluous menu items in IntelliJ:

1. Navigate to `File > Settings > Appearance & Behaviour > Menu and Toolbars`
2. Type the menu item that you want to hide in the search box, e.g. `Remove BOM`
3. Click the `-` button next to the search box.

The menu item will now be removed until you revert your configuration to defaults.
