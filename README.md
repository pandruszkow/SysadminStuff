ðŸš© Update schedule: irregular, but ongoing. I occasionally add interesting tips in batches and then cease activity for a bit, so feel free to star and check in every few months.

# SysadminStuff
- Configuration guides/checklist on setting up a new work machine
- A comprehensive .gitignore file that may give you some inspiration (check out the command aliases)
- Shell snippets and other scripts to make life/work easier (\*nix, \*nix on Windows, and \*nix on macOS)
- Virtual machine templates and other configuration files that I may use often

Please feel free to have a look around.
Pull Request for extra suggestions or corrections are welcome :)
