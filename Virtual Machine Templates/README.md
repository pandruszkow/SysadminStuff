Note: these VM images assume that you have a >=4 core/thread CPU, >4 GB of RAM and an SSD as your main virtual machine drive. Please modify accordingly if this is not the case with your setup.
For Windows-based templates, Windows is not included, so you have to supply your own. 

`Windows 7 Office 32-bit.ova` - basic VirtualBox template that will support the installation of Windows 7 on it, as well as give some reasonable settings that Microsoft Office will work with reasonably performantly. 
32-bit by default, adjust as required by changing machine type.

`Java EE Dev VM.ova` - a VM template tweaked to provide a good Java EE development experience when using an IDE. Optimised for use with the VM window in full-screen mode.
64-bit by default, adjust as required by changing machine type.
