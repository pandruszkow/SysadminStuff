Open Terminal keyboard shortcut
===============================

If you use a Linux-based environment on a daily basis, you may be used to typing `Ctrl + Alt + T` to instantly open a new Terminal window. This keyboard shortcut may be emulated on Windows without any third-party software.

**Steps:**

1. Locate a Windows application shortcut that can be used to launch your Terminal window (check All programs in the Start Menu if unsure).
2. Create a copy of that shortcut in a safe place.
3. Open the `Properties` window for that copy of the shortcut.
4. Navigate to the `Shortcut` tab.
5. Click on the `Shortcut key:` textbox and press the key combination that you want to launch the Terminal window with. I used `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
6. Click OK to close the `Properties` window.
	
If the shortcut isn't working, make sure that Explorer is currently running, and that at least one shortcut has your keyboard combo set on it. If my understanding is correct, it's actually Explorer running as the GUI shell that manages the behaviour of shortcuts.
